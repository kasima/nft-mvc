# NFT.MVC

Introducing NFT.MVC. We felt that the crypto space needed a chain-agnostic, developer-focused resource for developers to compare various smart contract platforms, whether they be L1s, L2s, bridges, etc.

Inspired by [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/), our goal is to build functionally identical non-fungible token contract on all smart contract platforms.

We aim to demonstrate the language, frameworks, deployment, and tooling for all supported platforms. Contracts will be built to the same test suite, as best we can, and use the same front end app.
