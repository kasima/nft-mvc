# AMM.MVC

Introducing AMM.MVC. We felt that the crypto space needed a chain-agnostic, developer-focused resource for developers to compare various smart contract platforms, whether they be L1s, L2s, bridges, etc.

Inspired by [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/), our goal is to build the _exact same_ Automated Market Maker (AMM) exchange on all smart contract platforms.

We aim to demonstrate the language, frameworks, deployment, and tooling for all supported platforms. Contracts will be built to the same test suite, as best we can, and use the same front end app.


## What's Implemented

- Token contracts (ERC-20 inspired)
- AMM contract (x * y = k)
- Tests
- Deployment scripts
- Framework, if applicable
- Web frontend
- Live on a testnet


## Supported Chains / Platforms / Languages / Frameworks

- Ethereum
  - Languages
    - Solidity / Hardhat
    - Vyper
    - YUL
- Optimism
- Arbitrum
- ZKSync
- StarkNet
  - Cairo
  - Solidity compiler
- Solana
- Polkadot
- Avalanche


## Contributions

All contributions welcome. Supported platforms chosen by our own interest. We do no descriminate on platforms as long as implementation requirements are met.
